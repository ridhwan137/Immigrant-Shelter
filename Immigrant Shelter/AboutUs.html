                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <p>Many migrant workers in Malaysia were already living in unsanitary conditions prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. These has caused many migrant workers to move out as they were prone to viruses and infections. 
                    Many companies had no businesses and were shut down during the pandemic out of bankruptcy. So, Immigrant Shelter is tasked for all actions connected to assisting immigrants, including temporary shelter, registration, paperwork, and immigration status determination, as well as the provision of shelter and basic necessities.</p>

                                    <hr>
                                    <p>Many migrant workers in Malaysia were already living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. It was not uncommon for them to be housed in converted shipping containers with limited access to clean water and sanitary amenities, for instance, in the construction sectors. These has caused many migrant workers to move out as they were prone to viruses and infections. There was no option for the affected migrant workers to seek help from during the outbreak. Many companies had no businesses and were shut down during the pandemic out of bankruptcy. This has given rise to income problem to workers especially to those migrant workers that suffered without a comfortable and clean place to live. </p>
